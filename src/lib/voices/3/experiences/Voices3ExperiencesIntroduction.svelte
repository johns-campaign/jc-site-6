  Checking through the Care Opinion and NHS Choices comments, reading the blogs
  of service users is one way to gain some insight of what it is like to be a
  patient or a family member in a dedicated mental health ward in a mental
  health trust. The examples included below have been contributed specifically
  for this Johnâ€™s Campaign project. They may seem negative but this is because
  of their self-selecting nature. They have been offered by people who believe
  passionately, from their own experience, that the care they observed or
  experienced in mental health units would have been improved if willing
  families had been more fully involved. Several of the contributors are nurses.
