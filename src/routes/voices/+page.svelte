<p>
  Throughout the campaign people have come forward and shared their voices -
  their testimony. The firsthand experience they've shared has been raw, real,
  and vital for making the case for change. We do our best to amplify these
  voices and do this in various ways; one of the ways is a periodic collection
  in a series we call <em>Voices</em>:

<ul>
  <li>
    <Voices1Link />
  </li>
  <li>
    <Voices2Link />
  </li>
  <li>
    <Voices3Link />
  </li>
  <li>
    <Voices4Link />
  </li>
</ul>
