<h1 class="top">
  <ThisLink>Resources</ThisLink>
</h1>
<p>
  Along the way, weâ€™ve built up a collection of resources. These are of a number
  of types: written resources, such as books, articles and individual accounts
  of experience. (Don't forget our blog site.) We've collected a number of
  videos, podcasts and audio recordings in addition to those on
  <CampaignYouTubeChannelLink>our YouTube page</CampaignYouTubeChannelLink>.
  Material resources which have been shared by participants include badges,
  banners; carer-awareness training, carer cards, charters, family rooms,
  passports and posters.
</p>
<p>
  Everything we host can be used by you: please give acknowledgement where
  appropriate.

  <ArticlesLink />

<p>
  An eclectic selection of articles from the Observer and other papers, running
  from
  <ExternalLink
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/29/nicci-gerrard-father-dementia-hospital-care-elderly">
    Nicci's initial article in December 2014</ExternalLink>
  to the present time.

<h2>
  <BooksLink />
</h2>
<p>
  With the exception of
  <BookLink id="beloved-old-age"><em>Beloved Old Age</em></BookLink>
  everything on here is freely downloadable. We'd also like to draw attention to
  our activity books
  <BookLink id="please-tell-me"><em>Please Tell Me</em></BookLink>
  and
  <BookLink id="please-tell-me-more"><em> Please Tell Me More</em></BookLink>
  which can be purchased at cost thanks to the generosity of sponsors.
</p>
<h2>
  <PicturesLink />
</h2>
<p>
  John's Campaign participants have been creative in the banners, badges,
  passports and posters that they've created to express their welcome to carers.
  They have shared images of these on their individual pages: you can search the
  collection here. If you are a part of John's Campaign perhaps you will be
  inspired to add to your own examples. Email them to
  <BertiesEmail />.
</p>
<h2>
  <ExperiencesLink />
</h2>
<p>
  When people tell you their stories, they are giving an invaluable gift. If
  John's Campaign were better managed and resourced these pages would have built
  into volumes. These are the tiniest tip of the iceberg of experiences that
  people have shared and which have formed our movement. All we can say is thank
  you for all the conversations, emails, phone calls, facebook messages that
  have taught us so much.
</p>
<h2>
  <VideosOfTheWeekLink />
</h2>
<p>
  Like many good ideas. we spent several months selecting and posting a variety
  of videos that happened to take our fancy at the time. The plan was to do this
  weekly, then they got a bit more sporadic .... Enjoy a rummage through.
</p>
<h2>
  <VoicesLink />
</h2>
<p>
  There have been particular moments when we have collected experiences into
  booklets: for the London conference at Imperial Healthcare in 2016 (Voices I),
  the 2017 Scottish conference in Lanarkshire (Voices II). Then there was the
  collection of mental health related testimony following the Age UK sponsored
  workshop in November 2017 (Voices III) and the presentation volume of pledges
  from all the English acute hospital trusts which we presented to CNO Jane
  Cummings in June 2018 (Voices IV).
